<p>Etymology

From Kannada/Telugu doni; compare with Persian dōnī ‘yacht’.[1]
History 

The traditional dhoni is one of the oldest known sea vessels in the Maldives. Many of these traditional sailing vessels were, of necessity, built using coconut palm timber. The sailing dhoni was used in earlier days by Maldivian fishermen. During the industrial revolution many fisherman changed to a mechanized dhoni.

The Tamil, Kannada and Konkani word for a small boat is doni and the Malayalam word for a small boat is tuoni, perhaps due to the tradelinks between Arabs and the Konkani people in Goa and other port cities in Konkan and Coastal South West India.[citation needed]
Construction

Dhonis used to be built without plans. The master carpenter took measurements and gave instructions to the carpenters.[2] Contemporary dhonis are often built using fibreglass. Dhonis fitted with diesel engines are extensively used on resort islands for scuba diving purposes, their low freeboard being ideal for this activity.

The islands of the Maldives have an extensive fishing fleet of vessels built domestically, each of which carries eight to twelve persons. Nearly all of these are variants of the dhoni, a plank-built craft traditionally built with coconut timber, although imported wood from Southeast Asia is increasingly used. Originally sailing craft, nowadays these boats are usually fitted with motors. The main site for building dhonis is in Alifushi in Raa Atoll. Dhoni building is a traditional craft in the Maldives, and young apprentices are trained by skilled craftsmen. Boats crafted from timber take 60 days to complete.
